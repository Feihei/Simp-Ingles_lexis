## Simplingua to English dictionary json database

This is based on the json on https://github.com/simplingua/simplingua commit f0c3d2c1b3e46815b8aaea3d1869de34cd04df9b
convert to line-seperated human readable json for you to edit

some rules to help:

1. Keep the structure of original json: {"Simplingua Word": "English explanations", ... }
2. Use "① + space + explanation 1; ② + space + explanation 2" for multiple explanations
3. Use n. for nouns, v. for verbs, etc., as it is in most English dictionaries

Thanks a lot to help!
